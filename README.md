# ContextualConvoCondenser

## Description
An NLP tool that summarizes lengthy conversation transcripts (like meetings or support calls) by identifying key decisions, action items, and sentiment shifts, providing more context than a simple word count summary.

## Features
- Input conversation transcript text (e.g., from Zoom, Teams, customer support logs).
- Utilizes transformer models (e.g., BART, T5 fine-tuned for summarization) combined with topic modeling (LDA) or entity recognition (NER) to understand context.
- Identifies and extracts key decisions, assigned action items (who needs to do what), and unanswered questions.
- Performs sentiment analysis over time segments to track conversation mood ('Vibe Check').
- Outputs a structured summary highlighting the extracted information and sentiment trends.

## Learning Benefits
Gain experience with advanced NLP techniques (transformer fine-tuning for summarization, NER, sentiment analysis), handling unstructured text data, combining multiple ML models for a complex task, and extracting structured information from conversations. Provides exposure to solving specific communication inefficiencies.

## Technologies Used
- transformers (Hugging Face)
- torch / tensorflow
- nltk / spaCy (for text processing, NER)
- scikit-learn (for topic modeling if used, sentiment analysis baseline)
- pandas
- numpy
